# Background

This project is intended to be an example project that anyone interested can go through to get a bit more familiar with git, github, React.js, and bootstrap.

Along the way here are some resources you may find helpful if you are new to these topics:

- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/why-react-bootstrap/)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Setup 

1. Install Node.js V.12.18.3 LTS for NPM package Manager (https://nodejs.org/en/)  

2. Follow the instruction on the Installation Package 

3. Check whether Node has been installed by typing “node -v” on your command line tool  

4. You are now ready to go! Pay Attention and try to follow along 

## Side Notes 

We recommend VSCode when working with React for the number of extension it has to list a few: 
- Prettier (for automatic formatting A MUST HAVE !!!) 
- Simple React Snippets (For Auto Complete) 
- You can also change theme through extension but that’s mainly up to you 

For windows, try to use git bash as your command line tool instead of command prompt as command prompt uses a slightly different command line language. 

## Getting started

- clone this repo, and create a new branch (once public it will be fork the repo and clone it)

- `npm start` to run the application locally
- View react bootstrap cards for inspiration (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/)
- commit the changes with your card to your branch
